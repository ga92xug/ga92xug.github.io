I'm currently writing my Master's Thesis at [AI in Medicine](https://aim-lab.io/) at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/). I study Data Engineering an Analytics with a focus on Deep Learning research. My interests are in:
- Explainable AI (xAI)
- Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
- Geometric Deep Learning: include symmetry information into model architecture to improve efficiency and generalization
 


Prior to my Master, I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Management and Technology with a focus on computer engineering at TUM.
